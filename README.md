# 📝 Incident Reports

This folder contains the incident reports I've completed as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.

Each report is based on a simulated company scenario. I follow a structured approach to analyze the incident, identify root causes and vulnerabilities, document the response process, and provide actionable recommendations to prevent future occurrences.
